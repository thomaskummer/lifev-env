        =============================
        DIDASKO : A Trilinos Tutorial
        =============================

This directory is organized as follows:

- doc/Trilinos70Tutorial.pdf:  PDF document containing the tutorial

- doc/Doxyfile:         doxygen documentation, type `doxygen' at the 
                        command line (in the doc subdirectory)
                        to create the Doxygen files

- src/                  latex files of the tutorial, type `make' at the
                        command line to compile the LaTeX sources 
                        (not included in the distribution)

- examples/             contains all the examples discussed in the PDF
                        document. The examples will be compiled if DIDASKO
                        has been enabled (by adding --enable-didasko to 
                        your Trilinos configure line).
