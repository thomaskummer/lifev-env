Trilinos development
====================
* Added example of user defined preconditioner with a JFNK forward operator to the thyra support.

* Removed all usage of EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator in favor of a direct inhertance from the Thyra::ModelEvaluator.  The EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator is being deprected.

* Added support for the Thyra Group to accept user defined preconditioners and Jacobian operators.

* Merged the object code for the library noxthyra into the main nox library to work around a circular dependency for the pseudo-transient solver.

* Added a pseudo-transient solver based on Thyra objects.  Still under development.
